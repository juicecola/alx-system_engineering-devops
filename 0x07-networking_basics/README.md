0x07. Networking basics #0
Networking refers to the process of connecting computers and devices together to share information and resources. Some common networking technologies include:

Local Area Network (LAN): Connects devices within a small geographic area, such as a home or office.

Wide Area Network (WAN): Connects devices over a large geographic area, such as a city or country.

Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): Connects devices within a metropolitan area, such as a city.

Wireless Network: Connects devices using wireless signals, such as Wi-Fi.

Internet Protocol (IP): A set of rules that govern how data is transmitted over a network.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): A set of rules that ensure reliable data transmission over a network.

Routing: The process of directing data from one device to another over a network.

Switching: The process of forwarding data from one device to another based on the destination address.

Firewall: A security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

These are the basic concepts of networking, there are many other technologies and techniques that build on these fundamentals to create more complex and advanced network systems.
