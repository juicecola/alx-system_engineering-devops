0x0A. Configuration management
Configuration management is the practice of tracking and controlling changes to software, hardware, and other configuration items throughout their lifecycle. It involves identifying, organizing, and controlling software and hardware changes to ensure that they are consistent, complete, and accurate.

Configuration management includes the following tasks:

Identification: Identifying all configuration items (CIs) that need to be managed.

Version control: Keeping track of different versions of configuration items and ensuring that only authorized changes are made.

Baseline management: Establishing baselines for different configuration items and controlling changes to those baselines.

Change management: Managing changes to configuration items through a change control process to ensure that changes are properly documented, evaluated, approved, and implemented.

Release management: Planning, scheduling, and coordinating the release of configuration items.

Audit and reporting: Performing audits to ensure that the configuration management process is being followed correctly, and generating reports to track the status of configuration items.

Configuration management is an essential part of software development and IT operations because it helps to ensure that changes to software and hardware are well-controlled and properly documented, and that different versions of configuration items are tracked and managed. This helps to improve the quality and reliability of software and hardware, reduce the risk of errors and defects, and enable more efficient and effective change management.
