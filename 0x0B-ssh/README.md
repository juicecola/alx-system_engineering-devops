0x0B. SSH
SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used to establish a secure and encrypted connection between two devices over an unsecured network. It is typically used for remote login or command-line access to a device, such as a server or a network router, allowing users to securely access and manage the device's command line interface from a remote location.

SSH provides a secure way to authenticate users and encrypt communications over the network. It uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote device and the user, and then establishes an encrypted session over which commands can be executed securely.

SSH can also be used for secure file transfers between devices, using the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) or SCP (Secure Copy) protocols.

SSH is widely used in the IT industry for system administration, remote access, and file transfers, and is available on most Unix-based systems as well as on Windows and macOS. It is also commonly used in cloud computing and web hosting environments for secure access to virtual servers and cloud instances.
