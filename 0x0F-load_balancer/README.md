0x0F. Load balancer
A load balancer is a software or hardware device that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources to prevent any single server from becoming overloaded or overwhelmed. Load balancing is typically used in large-scale web applications or websites that receive a high volume of traffic, and it helps to improve scalability, availability, and reliability of the application or website.
